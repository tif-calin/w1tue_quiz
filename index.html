                Mycorrhizal fungi
            </h2>

            <section id="sect-description">
                <p>
                    <span class="drop-cap">I</span>f you've ever enjoyed the shade of an oak, admired the sheer mass of a redwood, or delighted in the taste of a fruit or nut
                    that's come from a tree, you've benefitted from the work of mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizae are symbiotic relationships between
                    mycorrhizal fungi and plants. An estimated 80-95% of all plant species on earth make these types of associations, including
                    every single species of tree. This plant-fungi relationship is so ancient that it's thought to be critical in the story of how
                    plants first evolved to be able to live on land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mycorrhizal fungi attach to the plants roots and extend the range in which plants can get nutrients past the “depletion zone”
                    of the plants own roots. These fungi can break down chemicals in the ground into nutrients using special enzymes. These are
                    nutrients the plant might not otherwise be able to access. Studies have shown plants who've made these associations have up
                    to 4 times as much phosphorus as they would otherwise. Unfortunately, the addition of artificial phosphorus, 75-95% of which
                    remains inaccessible to plants, disrupts the complex chemical dance necessary for plant roots to successfully create their
                    mycorrhizal connection to the fungi.
                </p>
                <h3>Soil nutrition</h3>
                <p>
                    Where these fungi are present, they are responsible 27-30% of the carbon sequestered through their production of glomalin alone.
                    <cite>Soils inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi hold between
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-804312-7.00017-6">50-100 times more water</a> than those without it</cite> &mdash; a
                    critical fact for an
                    economic system where 70% of our water resources go to an agriculture dependent on "sterile dirt." The excess use of water is not
                    only harmful for our water resources, but also washes out more nutrients from the soil making agricultural soils even more
                    dependent on the addition of artificial fertilizers (yes, <i>that</i> artificial fertilizer that's causing those algae blooms you
                    see on TV juxtaposed onto images of millions of dead fish).
                </p>
                <h3>The OG internet is underground</h3>
                <p>
                    Studies have shown that, across many crop species, plants who have made these associations are consistently more resistent to
                    droughts, floods, high temperatures, and freezes. The worst realization of all is that these plants are also much more resistant
                    to nematodes and other soil pests that can harm plant roots &mdash; the very same pests that prompt farmers to sterilize their
                    soils, thereby killing the mycorrhizal fungi that would actually protect their crops. These underground networks have been
                    nicknamed the "Wood Wide Web" by soil researchers because of their role in allowing plants to communicate with each other.
                    <cite>Through these underground networks, trees can send warnings of pests, transmit nutrients to each other, store resources for
                    the winter, and even pass down
                    "<a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en/2020/02/trees-pass-on-environmental-memories-to-offspring.html">environmental memories</a>"
                    to their offsprings (yes, mother trees can recognize their own).</cite>

                    Below is an image of two potted tomato plants. One was inocculated with mycorrhizal fungi and the other was grown in sterile
                    soil. Can you guess which one's which?

                <h3>Practices that are harmful to mycorrhizal fungi</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fallowing (leaving land bare). This exposes fragile organisms to the sun and dries out the soil, leading to more topsoil
                        erosion. It also means arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have no plants to associate with and cannot get the carbon needed to
                        survive (they have about 7-10 days of carbon they can survive on without plants)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disturbing the soil through tilling, plowing, stock grazing, etc. This can destroy root systems, activate otherwise harmless
                        endophytic fungi, destroy the fragile spores of arbuscular fungi, destroys the mycellial network of mycorrhizal fungi, and
                        can dry out and expose organisms to the sun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Applying fungicides, fumigants, innoculents
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using fertilizers (especially high-phosphorus fertilizers). Changes to the chemical composition in soil can seriously affect
                        the development of mycorrhizae. Arbuscular mycorrhizal plants often grow two to three times larger if less fertilizer is used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using agircultural seed. Agricultural seed is often coated with fungicide. Additionally some crops have been genetically
                        modified to produce a natural insecticide called Bt (named after the bacteria that produces it <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>). Recent
                        research has shown the toxin to negatively impact helper organisms to mycorrhizal fungi.

                <h3>Where agriculture goes from here</h3>
                <p>
                    Although practices for protecting soil are known and exercised by many indigenous communities around the world, the specific 
                    research around mycorrhizal fungi is rather new to science. Our cultural approach to soil has been to fear it and sterilize all
                    possible threats in order to optimize short-term production, not realizing that this pursuit was only making us more susceptible
                    to these threats in the long term. Misunderstandings of soil life has been one of the key drivers of excess water waste, 
                    exploitation of third-world countries for their reserves of minerals important to fertilizer production, and loss of topsoil.
                    <cite>Researchers at the FAO have postulated we have 
                    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/">less than 60 years of topsoil left</a> 
                    for growing crops at the current rate of topsoil loss</cite>. <cite>More research has shown that the mineral content of vegetables has 
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163803/">decreased by over 90% from 1914 to 2018</a></cite>. 
                    <cite>Today you'd need to eat <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/soil-depletion-and-nutrition-loss/">eight times as many oranges</a>
                    as your grandparents did in order to get the same amount of vitamin A.</cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A renewed appreciation and commitment to the complex web of life that is soil is not only capable of dramatically decreasing
                    our environmental destruction and bringing us closer to the natural processes that allow us to live, but is imperative for the 
                    survival of us, our companion species, and all the more-than-human forms of life we inhabit this world with.
