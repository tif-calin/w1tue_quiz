## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
6) Think about how to validate each of your steps

## plan
1) HTML outline: create html outline: text, quiz button
1) CSS styling: properly style elements for readability and accessibility
1) create an isYes function. Test yes values and no values, making sure to test special cases 
1) Create and event handler function for the quiz button. This function should launch the quiz through prompts
1) keep track of results and update the page to display the results at the end
